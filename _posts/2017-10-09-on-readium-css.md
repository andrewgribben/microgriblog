[On Readium CSS][1]

I’ve followed [Jiminy Panoz ][2]since reading about the [Blitz Framework][3] so it’s great to see him working with EDRLab on Readium 2.

> We’ve put tremendous efforts into research, as there isn’t actually a lot available when it comes to ebooks. User Agents’ defaults System fonts available for various languages Typefaces users prefer Accessibility (typefaces, settings, global features, etc.) ebook authoring practices Recommendations to manage user settings on top of authors’ styles

This is an problem I know something about and have seen a number of publishers conduct this research privately, so it’s brilliant to have it out [in the open][4].
